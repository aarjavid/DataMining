Project Description
1) Create few items usually seen in Amazon, K-mart, or any other supermarkets 
2) Create a database of 20 transactions each containing some of these items. 
3) Repeat (1) by creating 4 additional, different databases each containing 20 transactions.
4) Using the Brute force technique, generate and print out all the association rules and the input transactions for each of the 5 transactional databases created.
5) Repeat (3) for Apriori algorithm. Min support and min confidence are user defined.
6) Compare Timing Performance for brute force vs apriori
7) Conclusion achieved - The association rules generated by the Apriori and Brute Force are the same.But, Apriori is much faster.
